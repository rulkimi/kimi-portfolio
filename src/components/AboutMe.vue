    <p>
      Even though I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree,
      I've always had a deep interest in programming since my foundation studies.
      After graduating, I realized my true passion was coding, so I did some research and got into web development.
      Working with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> instantly clicked for me — it
      felt like the perfect mix of design and logic that really spoke to my problem-solving mindset.

      Over the past year, I built <a href="https://rulkimi.github.io/kiminotes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kiminotes</a>,
      a personal knowledge repository to track everything I’ve learnt. I’ve also worked on a few projects,
      including a <a href="https://rulkimi.github.io/recipe-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recipe generator app</a>
      using <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue.js</a> and
      <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FastAPI</a>,
      where the recipes are generated using AI through the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini AI</a>. I always focus on clean,
      accessible designs and try to make everything as user-friendly as possible, both on the front and back end.

      When I’m not coding, I’m probably gaming, singing, or learning a new language.
      I’m always checking out new way to level up my skills.

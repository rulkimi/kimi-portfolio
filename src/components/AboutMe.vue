      My journey began in Mechanical Engineering, but I quickly found my passion in coding.
      The immediate results from working with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> drew me in,
      as it felt like an extension of my problem-solving mindset.
      From there, I dove deeper into web development, excited by the combination of design and logic.

      Over the last year, I’ve built <a href="https://rulkimi.github.io/kiminotes/" target="_blank"><strong>Kimi Notes</strong></a>,
      a personal knowledge repository documenting my learning journey.
      Alongside that, I developed various projects, including a <strong>recipe generation app
      </strong> using <strong>Vue.js</strong> and <strong>FastAPI</strong>. I always prioritize clean,
      accessible designs, aiming to create seamless user experiences through both front-end UI and back-end logic.

    <p>When I’m not coding, you can usually find me hiking, reading, or exploring new technologies to expand my skills even further.</p>
